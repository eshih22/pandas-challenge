Background:
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

PyCity Schools Analysis
Summary School Type: Charter school students have an overall passing rate of 90%, compared to only 53% of students passing in district schools. Looking into the individual subjects, the greatest descrepancy is in Math, where 93% of charter school students pass, while only 66% pass among their counterparts in district schools. Math needs to be an area of focus for District Schools.

School Size: The school size significanty influences the overall passing rate. Large schools, with student populations ranging from 2000 to 5000, have a passing rate of only 58%. While medium-sized schools (1000-2000 students) and small schools (fewer than 1000 students) have notably higher passing rates at 90% and 89%, respectively. This shows a trend where smaller and medium-sized schools tend to achieve higher overall passing rates compared to their larger counterparts.

Spending Ranges Per Student (Budget per Student):
There is also a correlation between the school budgets per student and overall passing rates. Schools with budgets of less than 585 per student have an impressive overall passing rate of 90%. However, as the budget per student increases, there is a noticeable decline in overall passing rates. Schools with budgets ranging from 585 to 630 show an 81 percent passing rate, while those in the 630-645 and 645-680 range experience further declines to 62% and 53%, respectively. This inverse relationship suggests that higher budgets per student are associated with lower overall passing rates.
